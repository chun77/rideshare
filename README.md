# Rideshare
This is a rideshare web application developed by me and my partner.


- Developed a secure ride-sharing web application using Django and PostgreSQL, focusing on robust authentication and role-specific
workflows, with enhanced user experience through session-based state management for ride matching and confirmation processes;
- Utilized Figma for a user-centric interface design, and Bootstrap for front-end development, ensuring a responsive interface;
- Deployed with Docker, fostering a robust development lifecycle and using a detailed "danger log" for ongoing system refinement.
